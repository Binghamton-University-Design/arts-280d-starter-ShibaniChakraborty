                <p>Zero is a Reploid from the Mega Man X games. Unlike Mega Man, Zero uses his Z-Saber to attack, therefore he relies more on close combat. There have been a few games where X and Zero are looking at the sunset, hence the inspiration from this picture.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Use References</a></h2>
            <p>Some people may think that using references is cheating, when really that's not the case. It's how you learn to learn to draw things like body anatomy and nature. You're not born knowing how to draw everything after all.<p>

            <h2><a href="">Keep a Sketchbook</a></h2>
            <p>Keeping a sketchbook is really useful when you want to practice drawing certain things and you want to keep the art in one place. Also, it's important to look back at old sketchbooks to see how much you've improved (no matter how embarrassing it may be).<p>

            <h2><a href="">Limit Your Color Palette</a></h2>
            <p>Limiting your palette makes the piece feel more cohesive as a whole. But if you do want to use more colors, make sure they work together. Change the values and hues of the colors so that they work together.<p>

            <h2><a href="">Sketch in Ballpoint Pen</a></h2>
            <p>For a long time, I didn't know that artists did this, but sketching in a ballpoint pen has many benefits. Because you can't erase, doing this activity will help you be more mindful with your strokes, and so it'll help you learn faster.<p>

            <h2><a href="">Expensive Art Supplies Don't Make Your Art Better</a></h2>
            <p>The skills that you develop are more important than what you draw with. There are people out there that make amazing art with cheap supplies or a limited amount of them, so focus on developing your skills as well as figuring out which supplies you want to use long term.<p>
